Welcome to my LeetCode solution repository! I'm a **Computer Science & Engineering student at The Ohio State University**, working toward a career in software engineering.

This repository contains all of my LeetCode solutions, written in Python, along with helpful resources I've used to study. It's a record of my progress and a tool to prepare for technical interviews as I search for internship and full-time opportunities.
